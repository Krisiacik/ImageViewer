The problem is image 1 is going to be displaced (gallery is being presented) and you can see that it is missing in the parent canvas because it "left the canvas" and the canvas bleeds its content through the overlay layer. However when you page to a different image and you decide to dismiss the gallery, that different image is going to be returned (using reveserse displacement). Thats look a bit strange because it is reverse displacing but it actually is already present in the parent canvas whereas the original image 1 is still missing there. Thre is no meaningful way to manage these deisplaced views. This setting helps to avoid it his problem by keeping the originals in place while still using the displacement effect.

    ///For the image to be reverse displaced, it must be visible in the parent view frame on screen, otherwise it's pointless to do the reverse displacement animation as we would be animating to out of bounds of the screen. However, there might be edge cases where only a tiny percentage of image is visible on screen, so reverse-displacing to that might not be desirable / visually pleasing. To address this problem, we can define a valid area that will be smaller by a given margin and sit centered inside the parent frame. For example, setting a value of 20 means the reverse displaced image must be in a rect that is inside the parent frame and the margin on all sides is to the parent frame is 20 points.
